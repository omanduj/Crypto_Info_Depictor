What you'll see
-----------
This project will create a webpage depicting the purchase and sell price of Cryto Currency's, specifically
Bitcoin and Ethereum from coinbase and blockchain. It will also provide recommendations in regards to what exchange one should buy and/or sell each coin.

The title of each exchange hovers above the selling/purchase prices of each respective coin. This title also serves as a link to the websites homepage. The text found below the prices is the recommendation in regards where the user should buy and sell each coin to obtain optimal profit. Below this recommendation is a button to the coin information at the exchange name found above.

You will also find information on Dogecoin at the bottom of the page, also informing on the purchase/selling price of each exchange.

The Check Me Out link is a fun little link to who made the page.
